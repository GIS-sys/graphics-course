# Step 1

```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. && make && ./tasks/inflight_frames/inflight_frames
```

Without simulating high load (min sdf step = 0.00001):
GPU: renderLocalShaderToy2 takes 8.54 ms, renderShader 7.55 ms, renderTexture 11.76 ms
CPU: < 1 ms

Simulating high load (min sdf step = 0.0000003):
GPU: renderLocalShaderToy2 takes 15.7 ms, renderShader 14.6 ms, renderTexture 12.4 ms
CPU: 6.07 ms

When vsync=false it doesn't really change, all in the boundaries of the measurement error.


Most time is spent in acquireNext (19 ms). Probably, that is why increasing the number of frames in flight will increase performance.



# Step 3

If numFramesInFlight=2, GPU timings stay the same. However, time spent in acquireNext reduced to 15ms. If numFramesInFlight=3 it reduces to 12ms

As for the artefacts - I can't see anything special. THe only thing is the frames seems to be... skipping a bit, like a some type of lag. But it may be just a 5-10fps experience

PS: added procedural objects to shader, hoping it will help with proper artefacts. But I haven't seen anything extraordinary
