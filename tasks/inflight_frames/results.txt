# Step 1

```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. && make && ./tasks/inflight_frames/inflight_frames
```

Without simulating high load (min sdf step = 0.00001):
GPU: renderLocalShaderToy2 takes 8.54 ms, renderShader 7.55 ms, renderTexture 11.76 ms
CPU: < 1 ms

Simulating high load (min sdf step = 0.0000003):
GPU: renderLocalShaderToy2 takes 15.7 ms, renderShader 14.6 ms, renderTexture 12.4 ms
CPU: 6.07 ms

When vsync=false it doesn't really change, all in the boundaries of the measurement error.


Most time is spent in acquireNext. Probably, that is why increasing the number of frames in flight will increase performance.
